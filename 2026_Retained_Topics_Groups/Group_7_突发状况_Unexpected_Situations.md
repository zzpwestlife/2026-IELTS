#### 英文答案：

段落 1：通用开头段
I want to share a memorable experience I had last Friday during a dinner with my university friends. It was a special gathering that brought back a lot of nostalgia and laughter.

段落 2：（话题 15）和亲友的晚餐
We decided to meet at a popular hotpot restaurant, which is famous for its delicious food. It was a small reunion, as we hadn't all been together since graduation. It's rare for all of us to be free, so we made a special plan to meet up and catch up. There were about five of us, and we were all really excited to catch up. One of my friends, Xiao Liu, even brought his new expensive camera to capture our moments together. We ordered a table full of meat and vegetables, and the hotpot was bubbling away. As we ate, we shared funny stories from our work lives and joked about our old college days. The atmosphere was so lively, it felt like we were back in our university days, just hanging out without a care in the world.

段落 3：（话题 14）突然停电
Just when we were about to take a group photo, something unexpected happened. Suddenly, the lights went out with a loud "bang," and the whole restaurant was plunged into darkness. At first, we were all a bit shocked and confused, but then we heard some laughter and chatter around us. The staff quickly brought out candles, and we found ourselves in a cozy, candle-lit environment. Instead of feeling annoyed, we embraced the situation. We joked that it was the "most romantic gathering ever" and continued to enjoy our hotpot. In that moment, we talked about deeper topics that we usually wouldn't discuss, and it felt like our bonds grew stronger.

段落 4：（话题 17）别人向你道歉
During this dinner, there was also a moment when Xiao Liu arrived late. He showed up an hour after everyone else, and we were all pretty hungry by then. When he finally arrived, he looked really guilty and immediately started apologizing to all of us, especially to me since I organized the dinner. He explained that he had forgotten his new camera at home and went back to get it, but got stuck in traffic. Hearing his explanation made me feel much better. I was actually touched that he cared so much about making our memories special. I told him, "It's okay, good food is worth the wait." Thanks to his camera, we ended up taking some amazing photos in the candlelight.

段落 5：通用结尾段
Looking back, that dinner was not just about the food; it was about reconnecting with old friends and creating new memories. The unexpected power outage turned out to be a highlight of the night, reminding me that sometimes, it's the little surprises that make moments unforgettable. I felt grateful for the friendships we have and how we can still share laughter and stories, no matter how much time has passed.

我想分享一个我上周五和大学朋友们共进晚餐的难忘经历。这是一次特别的聚会，带回了很多怀旧和欢笑。

段落 2：（话题 15）和亲友的晚餐
我们决定在一家受欢迎的火锅店见面，这里以美味的食物而闻名。这是一次重聚，因为自毕业以来我们都没有聚在一起。难得大家都有空，特意约出来叙旧。我们大约有五个人，大家都很兴奋能见面。我的一个朋友小刘甚至带来了他的新相机，想记录下我们的时刻。我们点了一桌子的肉和菜，火锅在冒泡。吃饭的时候，我们分享了工作中的趣事，开玩笑说起大学的往事。气氛非常热烈，仿佛我们又回到了无忧无虑的大学时代。

就在我们准备拍合影的时候，意想不到的事情发生了。突然，伴随着一声“啪”，整个餐厅陷入了黑暗。起初，我们都感到有些震惊和困惑，但随后听到周围传来的笑声和聊天声。工作人员迅速拿出了蜡烛，我们发现自己置身于一个温馨的烛光环境中。我们并没有感到烦恼，反而拥抱了这个情况。我们开玩笑说这是“最浪漫的聚会”，继续享受我们的火锅。在那一刻，我们聊了一些平时不太会讨论的深层话题，感觉彼此的关系更加紧密。

段落 4：（话题 17）别人向你道歉
在这次晚餐中，还有一个时刻是小刘迟到了。他比其他人晚了一个小时才到，大家都饿得不行。当他终于赶到时，脸上满是愧疚，立刻向我们所有人道歉，特别是向我这个组织者。他解释说，他忘记带新相机，回家取的时候又遇上了交通堵塞。听完他的解释，我心里的不快立刻消失了。我反而觉得很感动，因为他那么在意让我们的回忆变得特别。我拍拍他的肩膀说：“没关系，好饭不怕晚。”多亏了他的相机，我们在烛光下拍出了非常棒的照片。
