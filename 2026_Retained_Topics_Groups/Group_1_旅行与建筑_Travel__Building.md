### 3. 通用素材库：丽江古城之旅

**English Answer**

**(Opening)**
I’d like to talk about **Lijiang Ancient Town**, which is a place I visited a few years ago and would love to go back to. / It’s located in Yunnan Province, in the southwest of China. //
我想讲讲丽江古城，这是我几年前去过的一个地方，我很想再去一次。它位于中国西南部的云南省。

**(The Building/Place)**
One of the most interesting buildings there is the **Mufu Palace**. / It represents the history of the local Naxi people. / The architecture is a blend of Han and Naxi styles, / with intricate wood carvings and beautiful gardens. //
那里最有趣的建筑之一是木府。它代表了当地纳西族的历史。建筑风格融合了汉族和纳西族的特色，有精致的木雕和美丽的花园。

**(The Experience - Getting Lost)**
During my trip, I actually **got lost** in the winding streets of the old town. / The streets are paved with cobblestones and look quite similar, / so it’s easy to lose your sense of direction. / I was trying to find a famous restaurant / but ended up in a quiet residential area. //
在旅行期间，我其实在古城蜿蜒的街道里迷路了。街道是用鹅卵石铺成的，看起来很像，所以很容易迷失方向。我当时试图找一家著名的餐馆，结果走进了一个安静的居民区。

**(Resolution & Feeling)**
At first, I felt a bit **panicked** because my phone signal was weak. / But then I asked a local shop owner for help. / He was very friendly and pointed me in the right direction. / Getting lost actually let me discover some hidden corners of the town / that I wouldn't have seen otherwise. //
起初，我感到有点恐慌，因为我的手机信号很弱。但后来我向一位当地店主求助。他非常友好，给我指明了正确的方向。迷路实际上让我发现了古城中一些如果不迷路就看不到的隐秘角落。
