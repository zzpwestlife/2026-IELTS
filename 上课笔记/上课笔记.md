- PART 3 focuses more on SOCIETY & PEOPLE. 
- Use GENERAL TERMS & IDEAS. (EX: Someone, the people, etc.)

POINT (Opinion): Well, from my point of view, people smile more when they are younger. 

REASONS: One factor is that children are more innocent and carefree, so their smiles are natural and frequent. On the other hand, as people grow older, they face responsibilities and social pressure, which sometimes require being polite or put fake smiles rather than genuine ones. 

EXAMPLES: For instance, young children often smile while playing or spending time with friends without worrying about anything. In contrast, adults have many things to worry about, like salaries, jobs, their children's education, or their parents' health. 

CONCLUSION: Overall, people tend to smile more genuinely when they are young, while adults' smiles are often influenced by responsibilities and life pressures.

Try to practice answering Part 2 Questions.

Variety of sentences

Most of the time, I find my work a bit boring and repetitive. l attend meetings almost every day. Because of this, I don't have enough time to write all the codes that I need to accomplish within the deadline. Thus, l often work overtime to compensate for the time lost spent in meetings.

First, one should learn to use at least one programming languages such as PHP or Golang. Also, one should also need to adapt to use servers and databases. Last but not least, one should have enough knowledge on the financial industry.
