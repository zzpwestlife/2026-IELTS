### 3. 通用素材库：Bilibili 与《疯狂动物城》

**English Answer**

**[App & Movie]** I use the Bilibili app on my phone to watch movies with bilingual subtitles. Recently, I watched *Zootopia* on it. It’s an animation about a rabbit named Judy who dreams of becoming a police officer. I love this app because its category feature helps me find good learning materials easily. The movie inspired me with its theme of breaking stereotypes.

**[Story]** I also read a short story prequel about Judy’s childhood. It described how she was teased for being small but never gave up training. This story touched me because it showed her determination from a young age.

**[Famous Person]** I would like to meet the director, Byron Howard. I admire how he created such a deep story with humorous characters. I want to ask him about his inspiration for the fox and rabbit dynamic.

**中文翻译**

**[App与电影]** 我用手机上的 Bilibili 看双语电影。最近看了《疯狂动物城》，讲的是兔子 Judy 梦想当警察的故事。我喜欢这个 App 因为它的分类功能很好用。电影打破刻板印象的主题激励了我。
**[故事]** 我还读了一个关于 Judy 童年的前传短篇。讲她因个子小被嘲笑但从不放弃训练。这个故事展现了她的决心，很打动我。
**[名人]** 我想见导演 Byron Howard。我钦佩他能创作出既深刻又幽默的故事。我想问问他关于狐狸和兔子角色设定的灵感。
