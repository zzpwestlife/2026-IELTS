**English Answer**

**[App & Movie]** I use the Bilibili app on my phone to watch movies with bilingual subtitles. Recently, I watched *Zootopia* on it. It’s an animation about a rabbit named Judy who dreams of becoming a police officer. I love this app because its category feature helps me find good learning materials easily. The movie inspired me with its theme of breaking stereotypes.

**[Story]** I also read a short story prequel about Judy’s childhood. It described how she was teased for being small but never gave up training. This story touched me because it showed her determination from a young age.

**[Famous Person]** I would like to meet the director, Byron Howard. I admire how he created such a deep story with humorous characters. I want to ask him about his inspiration for the fox and rabbit dynamic.

**中文翻译**

**[App 与电影]** 我用手机上的 Bilibili 看双语电影。最近看了《疯狂动物城》，讲的是兔子 Judy 梦想当警察的故事。我喜欢这个 App 因为它的分类功能很好用。电影打破刻板印象的主题激励了我。
**[故事]** 我还读了一个关于 Judy 童年的前传短篇。讲她因个子小被嘲笑但从不放弃训练。这个故事展现了她的决心，很打动我。
**[名人]** 我想见导演 Byron Howard。我钦佩他能创作出既深刻又幽默的故事。我想问问他关于狐狸和兔子角色设定的灵感。

### 4. 补充素材：中英逐句对照版 (Supplementary Material: Chinese-English Ver.)

#### 英文答案：

段落 1：通用开头段
I'm going to share a story about how I discovered the amazing world of animation through an app called Bilibili, and how it led me to watch a fantastic movie called Zootopia. This journey not only entertained me but also taught me valuable lessons about dreams and breaking stereotypes.

段落 2：（话题 10&19）Apps / 程序 & 近期观影
One of my favorite apps is Bilibili, which I use on my phone. I usually open it two or three times a week, especially on weekends when I want to relax or practice my English. A friend recommended it to me, saying it has a lot of animated films and shows with bilingual subtitles, which are perfect for learning. What I love most is its category feature, which lets me quickly filter content like "English learning" or "animated movies." Last time, I found Zootopia in its "high-rated animation" section. Recently, I watched Zootopia on Bilibili. It's an animated movie about a rabbit named Judy who dreams of becoming a police officer despite facing prejudice. She teams up with a fox named Nick to solve a mystery, and together they uncover a conspiracy in their city. I chose to watch it because my friend said the bilingual subtitles would help me with my English, and I was also drawn to its theme of breaking stereotypes and pursuing dreams.

段落 3：（话题 19）近期观影
I watched Zootopia last Saturday night at home, all by myself. The movie really touched me because Judy's courage and Nick's transformation were so inspiring. I loved how it portrayed different animals and their lifestyles, making me laugh while also teaching me important lessons. The attention to detail in the movie was impressive, and I felt relaxed while watching it, but I also learned a lot about acceptance and understanding.

段落 4：（话题 7）最近读过的故事
Recently, I came across a short story on Bilibili, which happened to be a prequel to Zootopia. It focused on Judy's childhood—she was often teased by others for being small and told she couldn't be a police officer. But she never gave up on her dream and kept practicing running hard every day. Her parents were worried about her at first, but they eventually supported her after seeing how determined she was. Eventually, she won a race in her town, and that made everyone start believing in her. I really liked this story because it showed Judy's determination and growth. It reminded me that prejudice should never stop us from chasing our goals.

段落 5：（话题 2）想见的名人
After watching Zootopia, I became really interested in its director, Byron Howard. I found out about him from the credits after the movie. I learned that he also directed other great animations like Tangled. I would love to meet him at an animation festival and ask him about his inspiration for creating Zootopia, especially the character designs for Judy and Nick. I'm curious about why he chose a rabbit and a fox as the main characters and how he managed to convey such a deep message about breaking stereotypes in a humorous way. I admire his creativity and would love to hear his thoughts on animation, as it would help me understand storytelling and creativity better.

段落 6：通用结尾段
Overall, my experience with Bilibili and Zootopia has been incredibly rewarding. It has entertained me and inspired me to be brave and pursue my dreams, just like Judy.

#### 中文翻译：

段落 1：通用开头段
我要分享一个故事，讲述我如何通过一款名为 Bilibili 的应用程序发现了奇妙的动画世界，并由此观看了一部名为《疯狂动物城》的精彩电影。这段旅程不仅让我感到愉悦，也教会了我关于梦想和打破刻板印象的宝贵经验。

段落 2：（话题 10&19）应用程序 & 近期观影
我最喜欢的应用程序之一是 Bilibili，我把它安装在手机上。我通常每周打开两到三次，尤其是在周末，当我想要放松或练习英语的时候。一位朋友向我推荐了它，说上面有很多带有双语字幕的动画电影和剧集，非常适合学习。我最喜欢的是它的分类功能，可以让我快速筛选内容，例如“英语学习”或“动画电影”。上次，我在它的“高分动画”分类中发现了《疯狂动物城》。最近，我在 Bilibili 上观看了《疯狂动物城》。这是一部关于兔子朱迪的动画电影，她梦想成为一名警察，尽管面临偏见。她与一只名叫尼克的狐狸联手破案，并共同揭开了他们所在城市的阴谋。我选择观看这部电影是因为我的朋友说双语字幕可以帮助我提高英语水平，而且我也被它打破刻板印象和追逐梦想的主题所吸引。

段落 3：（话题 19）近期观影
上周六晚上，我独自在家观看了《疯狂动物城》。这部电影深深地打动了我，因为朱迪的勇气和尼克的转变都非常鼓舞人心。我喜欢它对不同动物及其生活方式的刻画，这让我开怀大笑的同时，也教会了我一些重要的道理。这部电影的细节处理令人印象深刻，观看时我感到很放松，同时也学到了很多关于接纳和理解的知识。

段落 4：（话题 7）近期读过的故事
最近，我在哔哩哔哩上读到一篇短篇小说，它恰好是《疯狂动物城》的前传。故事聚焦于朱迪的童年——她因为个子矮小经常被嘲笑，别人也说她当不了警察。但她从未放弃梦想，每天坚持刻苦训练跑步。起初她的父母很担心，但看到她如此坚定，最终还是支持了她。后来，她赢得了镇上的一场比赛，这让所有人都开始相信她。我非常喜欢这个故事，因为它展现了朱迪的决心和成长。它提醒我，偏见永远不应该阻止我们追求梦想。

段落 5：（话题 2）想见的名人
看完《疯狂动物城》后，我对它的导演拜伦·霍华德产生了浓厚的兴趣。我在电影结束后的演职员表中了解到了他。我了解到他还执导过其他优秀的动画电影，比如《长发公主》。我希望能在一个动画节上见到他，问问他创作《疯狂动物城》的灵感来源，特别是朱迪和尼克这两个角色的设计。我很好奇他为什么选择兔子和狐狸作为主角，以及他是如何以幽默的方式传达打破刻板印象这一深刻主题的。我欣赏他的创造力，也很想听听他对动画的看法，这能帮助我更好地理解故事讲述和创意。

段落 6：通用结尾段
总而言之，我在哔哩哔哩和《疯狂动物城》的体验非常棒。它不仅娱乐了我，还激励我像朱迪一样勇敢地追逐梦想。
