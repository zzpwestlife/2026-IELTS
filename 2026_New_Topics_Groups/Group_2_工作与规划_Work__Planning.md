### 3. 通用素材库：活动策划师 Xiao Zhang

**English Answer**

**[Perfect Job]** My perfect job is being an event planner. I first became interested in this career while working with my friend Zhang in our university club. To do this job well, I need to learn event design and risk management. I think this job suits me because it’s creative and challenging, and I enjoy seeing people happy at a successful event.

**[Smart Problem Solving]** Let me tell you about Zhang. Last year, the day before a music festival he organized, the venue was suddenly closed. Everyone was stressed, but Zhang didn’t panic. He used a backup list of venues he had prepared and secured a new park within an hour. He updated everyone via social media immediately. His quick thinking saved the day.

**[Good at Planning]** Zhang is also amazing at planning. He always uses a "double checklist": one timeline for tasks and one list for role assignments. He even makes contingency plans for unexpected issues. His organized approach inspired me to value planning and anticipation, which is key to being a good event planner.

**[Conclusion]** I feel lucky to have found my passion through Zhang. His skills inspired me to pursue this career path.

**中文翻译**

**[完美工作]** 我理想的工作是活动策划师。我是在大学社团和朋友张一起工作时对这个职业感兴趣的。做这份工作需要学习活动设计和风险管理。我觉得它很适合我，因为既有创意又有挑战。
**[机智解决]** 说说张。去年音乐节前一天场地突然关闭，大家都很焦虑，但他没慌。他启用了备选场地名单，一小时内搞定了一个新公园，并迅速通知了所有人。他的急智挽救了局面。
**[擅长计划]** 张也非常擅长计划。他总是用“双重清单”：一份时间表，一份任务分配表。他甚至会做应急预案。他有条理的工作方式激励了我，让我意识到规划对于活动策划的重要性。
**[结尾]** 我很幸运通过张找到了我的热情，他的技能激励我追求这份职业。
