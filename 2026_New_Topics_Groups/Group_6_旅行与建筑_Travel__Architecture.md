### 3. 通用素材库：荷兰骑行与风车

**English Answer**

**[Short Stay & Trip]** I’m planning a one-week trip to Amsterdam in the Netherlands with my friend. Since we only have a short vacation, we want to make the most of it by cycling. The Netherlands is known as the kingdom of cycling, with safe paths everywhere. We plan to ride from the city to the countryside to enjoy the scenery at our own pace.

**[Architecture]** The most interesting building I want to see is a traditional windmill house. It sits beside a canal, made of wood with a red roof and large blades. Historically used for grinding grain, many are now museums. I find them fascinating because they combine practicality with artistic beauty, perfectly integrated into the Dutch landscape.

**中文翻译**

**[短暂停留与旅行]** 我计划和朋友去荷兰阿姆斯特丹玩一周。因为假期短，我们打算骑自行车游览。荷兰是自行车王国，车道很安全。我们计划从城市骑到乡村，按自己的节奏欣赏风景。
**[建筑]** 我最想看的是传统的风车屋。它坐落在运河边，木质结构配红屋顶和大叶片。历史上它用于磨粮，现在很多变成了博物馆。我觉得它既实用又美观，完美融入了荷兰的风景。
