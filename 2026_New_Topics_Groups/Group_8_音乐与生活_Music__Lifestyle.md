### 3. 通用素材库：古典音乐会的意外插曲

**English Answer**

**[Unenjoyable Music]** I went to a classical concert last month. I expected to enjoy it, but the music was too slow and soothing, making me sleepy. The atmosphere was overly serious, and I couldn't connect with the performance despite the musicians' skills.

**[No Phone]** We were not allowed to use phones and had to put them in sealed bags. At first, I was annoyed because I wanted to take photos. I felt fidgety without my phone, but eventually, I had to just sit there and listen.

**[Smiling]** After the concert, a staff member started mimicking the sounds of violins to cheer up the tired crowd. His humor broke the tension, and everyone started laughing and smiling. It turned a boring night into a warm memory.

**中文翻译**

**[不享受的音乐]** 上个月我去听古典音乐会。原本很期待，但音乐太缓以至于我想睡。气氛太严肃，我无法产生共鸣。
**[禁止手机]** 我们被禁止用手机，必须封存。起初我很烦因为想拍照。没手机让我坐立难安，但最后只能干坐着听。
**[微笑]** 散场时，一个工作人员模仿小提琴的声音来逗乐疲惫的人群。他的幽默打破了紧张感，大家都笑了。这让无聊的夜晚变得温馨。
