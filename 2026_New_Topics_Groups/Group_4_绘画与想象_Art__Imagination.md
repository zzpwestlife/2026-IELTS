### 3. 通用素材库：小侄子 Xiaoyu 的外星世界

**English Answer**

**[Child who loves drawing]** I want to talk about my 5-year-old nephew, Xiaoyu. He draws almost every day and carries a mini sketchbook everywhere. He loves drawing imaginative things like magical forests and alien spaceships. Drawing allows him to express his thoughts freely.

**[Using Imagination]** Last Saturday, I drew with him. He wanted to create an alien planet but got stuck. He asked for my help, so we started brainstorming together. We imagined a planet with a purple sky, twinkling stars, and aliens that looked like rabbits with wings. Following his lead, I found my creative flow. The process was really enjoyable and reminded me how freeing it is to create without overthinking.

**中文翻译**

**[爱画画的孩子]** 我想说说我5岁的侄子小宇。他几乎每天画画，随身带着速写本。他喜欢画魔法森林、外星飞船等充满想象力的东西。
**[发挥想象力]** 上周六我陪他画画。他想画外星星球但卡住了，让我帮忙。于是我们一起头脑风暴，想象了一个有紫色天空、闪烁星星和长翅膀兔子的星球。跟着他的思路，我也找到了灵感。这个过程让我意识到无拘无束地创作是多么自由。

### 4. 补充素材：中英逐句对照版 (Supplementary Material: Chinese-English Ver.)

#### 英文答案：

段落 1：通用开头段
I'm going to share a delightful story about my little nephew, who has a huge passion for drawing. His name is Xiaoyu, and he's just five years old. In fact, I've been lucky enough to witness his love for art since he picked up his first crayon at the age of three.

段落 2：（话题 8）喜欢画画的孩子
Xiaoyu is my sister's son, and I visit him every week. He draws almost every day after kindergarten, spending about an hour at his little desk, and on top of that, he goes to a kids' art class on weekends. He carries his mini sketchbook everywhere, doodling while waiting for food or during car rides. His sketchbook is filled with imaginative drawings, like rabbits with wings, colorful alien spaceships, and magical forests. Basically, I think he loves drawing because it allows him to express his thoughts freely.

段落 3：（话题 22）发挥想象力
Last Saturday afternoon, I went to my sister's house to draw with Xiaoyu. He wanted to create an alien fantasy planet, but he only sketched a round outline and got stuck on the details. So, he pulled my hand and asked me to help him brainstorm. At first, I was a bit stuck too, so I asked him what his planet looked like in his mind. Following his lead, I found inspiration easily, and we started imagining what the aliens would look like, the color of the sky, and even added twinkling stars and a ring around the planet. The whole process was really enjoyable, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment when we finished. I was inspired by his pure imagination and realized how freeing it is to just create without overthinking.

段落 4：通用结尾段
I feel grateful for the time spent with Xiaoyu. His enthusiasm for drawing and imaginative ideas reminds me of the joy of creativity. Overall, I hope to keep encouraging him in his artistic journey.

#### 中文翻译：

第一段：通用开头段
我要分享一个关于我小侄子的小故事，他非常热爱绘画。他叫小宇，今年五岁。事实上，我很幸运地见证了他对艺术的热爱，从他三岁拿起第一支蜡笔开始。

第二段：（话题 8）喜欢画画的孩子
小宇是我姐姐的儿子，我每周都会去看他。他几乎每天放学后都会画画，在他的小书桌前待上大约一个小时，除此之外，他周末还会去上儿童美术课。他总是随身带着他的迷你素描本，等饭的时候或者坐车的时候都会涂涂画画。他的素描本里画满了充满想象力的画作，比如长着翅膀的兔子、色彩斑斓的外星飞船和神奇的森林。我觉得他喜欢画画是因为它能让他自由地表达自己的想法。

第三段：（话题 22）发挥和计划
上周六下午，我去姐姐家和小宇一起画画。他想画一个外星奇幻星球，但他只画了个圆的轮廓，细节部分就卡住了。于是，他拉着我的手，让我帮他一起集思广益。一开始我也有点不知所措，就问他脑海中的星球是什么样子。跟着他的思路，我很快就找到了灵感，我们开始想象外星人的样子、天空的颜色，甚至还加上了闪烁的星星和环绕星球的光环。整个过程非常愉快，完成后我感到很有成就感。他纯粹的想象力启发了我，让我意识到不加思考地创作是多么自由。

第四段：通用结尾段
我很感激和小宇一起度过的时光。他对绘画的热情和丰富的想象力让我感受到了创作的乐趣。总而言之，我希望继续鼓励他在艺术道路上前行。
