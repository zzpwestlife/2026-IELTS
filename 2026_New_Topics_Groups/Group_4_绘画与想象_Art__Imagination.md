### 3. 通用素材库：小侄子 Xiaoyu 的外星世界

**English Answer**

**[Child who loves drawing]** I want to talk about my 5-year-old nephew, Xiaoyu. He draws almost every day and carries a mini sketchbook everywhere. He loves drawing imaginative things like magical forests and alien spaceships. Drawing allows him to express his thoughts freely.

**[Using Imagination]** Last Saturday, I drew with him. He wanted to create an alien planet but got stuck. He asked for my help, so we started brainstorming together. We imagined a planet with a purple sky, twinkling stars, and aliens that looked like rabbits with wings. Following his lead, I found my creative flow. The process was really enjoyable and reminded me how freeing it is to create without overthinking.

**中文翻译**

**[爱画画的孩子]** 我想说说我5岁的侄子小宇。他几乎每天画画，随身带着速写本。他喜欢画魔法森林、外星飞船等充满想象力的东西。
**[发挥想象力]** 上周六我陪他画画。他想画外星星球但卡住了，让我帮忙。于是我们一起头脑风暴，想象了一个有紫色天空、闪烁星星和长翅膀兔子的星球。跟着他的思路，我也找到了灵感。这个过程让我意识到无拘无束地创作是多么自由。
