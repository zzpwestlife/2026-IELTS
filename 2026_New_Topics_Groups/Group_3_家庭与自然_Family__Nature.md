### 3. 通用素材库：环保志愿者姐姐

**English Answer**

**[Helpful & Nature]** I want to share a story about my sister. She is a passionate environmental volunteer who helps others without expecting anything in return. She organizes community clean-ups and taught me eco-friendly habits like recycling and planting trees from a young age. Her enthusiasm motivates me to protect nature too.

**[Proud Moment]** Last autumn, she received the "Outstanding Environmental Volunteer" award. Seeing her on stage sharing her experiences made me incredibly proud. She encouraged everyone to live a low-carbon lifestyle. That moment made me realize she is a role model for our community.

**[Important Item]** Our family keeps a special photo album she started ten years ago. It’s filled with photos of our family joining environmental activities and her receiving the award. It’s a meaningful keepsake that reminds us of our shared values and why protecting the environment is important to our family.

**中文翻译**

**[乐于助人与自然]** 我想讲讲我姐姐。她是个热情的环保志愿者，总是无偿帮助别人。她组织社区清洁活动，并从小教我垃圾分类和植树。她的热情激励我也去保护自然。
**[骄傲时刻]** 去年秋天，她获得了“杰出环保志愿者”奖。看到她在台上分享经历，我感到无比骄傲。她鼓励大家过低碳生活，那一刻我意识到她是社区的榜样。
**[重要物品]** 我们家珍藏着一本她十年前开始做的相册，里面满是我们参加环保活动和她领奖的照片。这是一份有意义的纪念品，提醒我们家庭共同的价值观。
