### 3. 通用素材库：万达广场与 Apple Watch

**English Answer**

**[Tech & Spending]** The tech product I wanted was the Apple Watch SE. I planned to spend around 2000 yuan, but I ended up spending over 3000 because I bought an extra original strap and a higher configuration. I bought it at the digital store in Wanda Plaza. Although it was expensive, I think it was worth it because it helps me track my fitness and stay connected.

**[Shopping Mall]** Wanda Plaza is my go-to mall, located just 5 minutes from the subway. I visit it once or twice a week. It has everything from trendy snack bars in the basement to clothing stores like Uniqlo on the first floor. It’s a great place to hang out with friends, dine, and shop for daily necessities.

**中文翻译**

**[科技与消费]** 我想买 Apple Watch SE。原计划花2000元，但为了原装表带和高配置，最后花了3000多。我是在万达广场的数码店买的。虽然超支了，但我觉得很值，因为它帮我监测健康。
**[商场]** 万达广场是我常去的商场，离地铁站就5分钟。我每周去一两次。那里应有尽有，从地下的网红小吃到底层的优衣库。这是个和朋友吃饭、购物的好去处。
