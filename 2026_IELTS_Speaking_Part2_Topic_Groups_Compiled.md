### 3. 通用素材库：Tom 自学 Python

**English Answer**

**[Intro]** I want to share a story about my friend Tom and how he learned programming, specifically Python. This experience not only changed his career path but also taught me a lot about patience and encouragement.

**[Advice & Encouragement]** About three months ago, Tom decided to learn Python. He had almost no background in computers, so he felt nervous and scared of making mistakes. One evening, he came to me, feeling upset and wanting to give up. I gave him two simple pieces of advice. First, I told him that programming is all about trial and error. Second, I suggested he start with the absolute basics, like variables and loops, instead of rushing. I knew that setting small, achievable goals would help him build confidence.

**[Learning Process]** Tom is a university friend who taught himself Python to change his career from administration to IT. He studied online with a beginner course every evening. He kept a notebook for mistakes and practiced coding problems on weekends. I really admire his perseverance. Even when he ran into errors, he never stopped trying. Self-study allowed him to arrange his time freely, and surprisingly, fixing problems alone helped him understand the language much better.

**[Conclusion]** Looking back, I feel really proud of Tom. His journey taught me that learning a new skill takes time, and encouragement can make a big difference.

**中文翻译**

**[开头]** 我想分享我的朋友 Tom 自学 Python 的故事。这段经历不仅改变了他的职业道路，也让我学到了耐心和鼓励的重要性。
**[建议与鼓励]** 大约三个月前，Tom 决定学 Python。他零基础，所以很害怕犯错。有天晚上他很沮丧地想放弃。我给了他两条建议：第一，编程就是试错的过程；第二，从基础语法开始，不要急于求成。我知道设定小目标能帮他建立自信。
**[学习过程]** Tom 是为了转行 IT 而自学的。他利用每晚时间上网课，并整理错题本。我非常通过他的毅力，即使遇到报错也从不停止尝试。自学让他时间更自由，而且独自解决问题让他对语言理解得更深。
**[结尾]** 回想起来，我为 Tom 感到骄傲。他的经历让我明白学习新技能需要时间，而鼓励至关重要。

To do this job well, I need to learn event design and risk management. I think this job suits me because it’s creative and challenging, and I enjoy seeing people happy at a successful event.

**[Smart Problem Solving]** Let me tell you about Zhang. Last year, the day before a music festival he organized, the venue was suddenly closed. Everyone was stressed, but Zhang didn’t panic. He used a backup list of venues he had prepared and secured a new park within an hour. He updated everyone via social media immediately. His quick thinking saved the day.

**[擅长计划]** 张也非常擅长计划。他总是用“双重清单”：一份时间表，一份任务分配表。他甚至会做应急预案。他有条理的工作方式激励了我，让我意识到规划对于活动策划的重要性。
**[结尾]** 我很幸运通过张找到了我的热情，他的技能激励我追求这份职业。

The process was really enjoyable and reminded me how freeing it is to create without overthinking.
